This spotlight talk presented the **BIG-TB** dataset — a multimodal benchmark of ~17,000 *M. tuberculosis* isolates curated to advance antibiotic resistance prediction and model interpretability.  
The presentation highlighted how integrating **sequence, structural, and evolutionary features** enables models to generalize across resistance mechanisms and better align with biological reality.

Key topics discussed:
- Dataset design principles and integration of **WHO 2023 resistance catalogues**  
- Evaluation of **sequence-based (ESM, CNN) vs structure-aware models**  
- Insights from **causal variant discovery** and explainability metrics (SHAP, Recall@k)

This work underscores the importance of interpretable, biologically grounded ML systems for global health and precision diagnostics.
