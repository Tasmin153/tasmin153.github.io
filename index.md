👋 **Welcome!**
I’m **Mahbuba Tasmin**, a Ph.D. candidate in **Computer Science** at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**, advised by [Prof. Anna Green](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~annagreen/). I work in the **SAGE Lab** (Statistical and Genomic Evidence Lab), where my research bridges **machine learning**, **computational biology**, and **antibiotic resistance genomics**.

My current focus is on building **interpretable, biology-grounded models** for predicting **drug resistance in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*** — combining **sequence-based deep learning**, **evolutionary augmentation**, and **causal variant discovery**.

I’m particularly interested in:

* Genomic and protein-based ML for resistance prediction
* Causal interpretability and structural biology
* Cross-species learning and data augmentation
* Benchmark dataset design for biological ML models

### 🔬 Research Highlights

* **BIG-TB Benchmark (17K isolates, 11 drugs):** Developing a unified dataset and evaluation framework for resistance prediction across modalities.
* **Resistance Forecast Project:** Integrating structural, evolutionary, and machine-learning features to predict variant impact.
* **Evolutionary Augmentation:** Leveraging multi-species homologs to enhance sparse training data for protein-level models.

You can read more about these in my [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/portfolio/).

### 📚 Teaching & Mentorship

I serve as a **Teaching Assistant for CS520 (Software Testing)** at UMass, where I help students design and evaluate test coverage, mutation analysis, and automated testing frameworks in Java.
I also mentor undergraduate and master’s students in research on ML for biological sequences.

### 🧠 Beyond Research

Outside the lab, I enjoy **clay crafts, photography, and event organization** — from handmade air-dry clay bowls to campus community events. I also contribute to **graduate student initiatives** at UMass through organizing academic and social programs.
