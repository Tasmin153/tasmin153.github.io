**Summary:** Presents a structure-aware hybrid model that injects contact-map priors and residue-level constraints into sequence-based predictors to maintain interpretability with limited labeled isolates. Demonstrates improved accuracy across sparse genomic datasets for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.
