excerpt: "We introduce a structure-aware framework that combines deep learning and structural bioinformatics to improve resistance prediction in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* under sparse data settings."

We present a hybrid model integrating sequence embeddings, and 3D-proximity constraints to enhance interpretability and accuracy in antibiotic resistance prediction. Evaluations across 11 drugs show consistent gains over sequence-only baselines.
